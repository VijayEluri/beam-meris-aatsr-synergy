        <para>
            The Synergy Preprocessor is the first of three main modules within the MERIS/(A)ATSR Synergy toolbox.
            Its purpose is to create a colocated MERIS/(A)ATSR L1b product containing radiances/reflectances of
            all channels of both MERIS and AATSR. This colocated product shall be used as input for the cloud screening
            module.
        </para>
        <para>
            There is no separate user interface for the Synergy Preprocessor,
            also, there are no processing parameters. The preprocessor is invoked automatically
            when a MERIS/AATSR colocated product is generated either as final product or as intermediate
            product required for cloud screening or aerosol retrieval. These options are provided through
            radio buttons on the Synergy Toolbox I/O Parameters Tab Pane (see below).

            The Processor for Aerosol Retrieval and Atmospheric Correction is the third of three main modules

            Its purpose is to derive aerosol optical depths over land and/or ocean and (optionally) provide an
            atmospheric correction by using the derived AODs. The processor also makes use of quantities
            derived from the cloud screening module. Therefore, the input for the aerosol retrieval must be

                       Due to the nature of the algorithm, the retrieval of surface directional

                       If you are interested in aerosol quantities only, it is recommended to keep
                       this option unselected. For the computation of surface directional reflectances
                       on larger datasets, it is further recommended to create in advance subsets of
